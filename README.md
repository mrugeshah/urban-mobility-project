# AWS, Azure & DevOps Implementation for an Urban Mobility Platform

## Project Description
Implemented a robust DevOps pipeline for an automobile platform that provides vehicle listings, user reviews, dealer integrations, and vehicle data. The objective was to enhance deployment automation, improve system reliability, and enable seamless CI/CD workflows to support continuous software releases.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- Designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using **BitBucket** and **Azure DevOps** to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
- Managed infrastructure as code (IaC) using **Terraform** and **AWS CloudFormation** to provision cloud resources dynamically.
- Configured and optimized **Kubernetes (EKS) and Docker** container orchestration for microservices deployment.
- Implemented **AWS services** such as **EC2, S3, API Gateway, RDS, Lambda, System Manager, Event Bridge, and IAM** for scalable and secure cloud infrastructure.
- Implemented **Azure services** such as **App Service, Function App, Cloud Database, Azure Monitor, and  Azure CDN** for scalable and secure cloud infrastructure.
- Developed **monitoring and logging solutions** using **Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch** to improve system observability.
- Automated security scanning and compliance checks using **AWS Security Hub and SonarQube**.
- Integrated **blue-green and canary deployments** to ensure zero downtime during application updates.
- Conducted performance tuning, load testing, and scalability improvements using **Blazemeter**.
- Collaborated with development and operations teams to enhance DevSecOps practices and improve deployment frequency.
